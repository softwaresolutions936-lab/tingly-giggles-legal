  <h1>Tingly Giggles – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <small>Last updated: 15 November 2025</small>

  <h2>1. About this policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Tingly Giggles (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles
    information in connection with the Tingly Giggles tool and related services
    (the “Service”). The Service is primarily used by a single creator to plan
    and publish short-form ASMR-style content to platforms such as TikTok and
    YouTube.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy is intended to give a clear, simple explanation and does not
    replace any privacy terms provided by TikTok, YouTube, or other platforms
    you use.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on how you use the Service, we may process the following categories
    of information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account identifiers from platforms you connect:</strong>
      for example, IDs or usernames that TikTok or other platforms provide
      when you authorise the Service to post on your behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Access tokens and technical credentials:</strong>
      tokens or keys that allow the Service to upload content to your TikTok
      or other connected accounts, subject to the permissions you grant.</li>
    <li><strong>Content and metadata you provide:</strong>
      such as video files, titles, descriptions, hashtags, and other details
      used to publish your ASMR content.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic usage information:</strong>
      for example, logs indicating that an upload was attempted, succeeded,
      or failed, and simple error messages that help diagnose issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Service does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information
    such as financial details, health information, or government-issued IDs.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How we obtain information</h2>
  <p>
    We obtain information in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directly from you:</strong>
      when you configure the Service, connect your accounts, or provide
      content, titles, and descriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>From third-party platforms:</strong>
      when you authorise the Service via TikTok, YouTube, or other platforms,
      those platforms provide access tokens and limited account information
      needed to perform actions you request (such as uploading a video).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How we use information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the information described above to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate ideas and metadata for your content (for example, titles and captions);</li>
    <li>Upload and publish videos to platforms you connect, on your behalf and with your permission;</li>
    <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Service;</li>
    <li>Diagnose and fix technical problems (for example, understanding why an upload failed).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Legal basis (where applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    Where data protection laws require a legal basis (for example, in the UK or EU),
    we rely on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong>
      to provide the functionality you expect from the Service;</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong>
      to operate and improve the Service, keep it secure, and prevent misuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing of information</h2>
  <p>
    We may share information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With the platforms you connect:</strong>
      for example, when publishing a video to TikTok, we send the video and
      associated caption/metadata to TikTok via their APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>With service providers:</strong>
      where necessary to host or operate the Service (for example, cloud
      infrastructure or logging providers), subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>When required by law:</strong>
      if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to comply with legal
      obligations or to respond to lawful requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    Information is kept only for as long as necessary to operate the Service
    and achieve the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer
    retention period is required or permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may revoke access tokens or permissions from your TikTok or other
    connected accounts at any time using those platforms’ settings. Doing so
    may prevent the Service from being able to post on your behalf.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights and choices</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to certain information we hold about you;</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate information;</li>
    <li>Deletion of certain information;</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection to certain processing; and</li>
    <li>Portability of certain information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since Tingly Giggles is a limited, creator-focused tool, requests can
    typically be handled by contacting the creator directly using the contact
    details provided in the app or social profiles.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is intended for use by adults managing their own social media
    accounts. It is not directed at children, and we do not knowingly collect
    personal data from children. If you believe information about a child has
    been collected in connection with the Service, please contact us so that
    it can be reviewed and, where appropriate, removed.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to help protect
    information processed in connection with the Service. However, no system
    can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of
    information transmitted or stored.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
    update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use
    of the Service after any changes means you acknowledge the updated policy.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how Tingly Giggles
    handles information, you can contact the creator of the tool using the
    details shared in the app or on the associated social media profiles.
