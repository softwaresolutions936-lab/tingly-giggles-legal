  <h1>Tingly Giggles – Terms of Service</h1>
  <small>Last updated: 15 November 2025</small>

  <h2>1. About Tingly Giggles</h2>
  <p>
    Tingly Giggles (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a personal creator tool used to plan and
    publish short-form ASMR-style videos to social media platforms such as TikTok and
    YouTube. The tool helps generate ideas, organise content, and simplify posting,
    but it does not provide any official TikTok or YouTube functionality on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Tingly Giggles app,
    scripts, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service,
    you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Not an official TikTok or YouTube product</h2>
  <p>
    Tingly Giggles is an independent tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
    or sponsored by TikTok, YouTube, or any other platform. Your use of those
    platforms remains subject to their own terms, policies, and community guidelines.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Who may use the Service</h2>
  <p>
    You may use Tingly Giggles only if:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your region); and</li>
    <li>You are legally allowed to connect and manage your own social media accounts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all
    applicable laws and the rules of any platform you connect (for example, TikTok’s
    and YouTube’s terms and community guidelines).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your accounts & access tokens</h2>
  <p>
    To publish content, you may choose to connect your TikTok or other social media
    accounts to the Service using access tokens or API credentials. These are used
    only to perform actions you have requested (such as uploading a video) on your
    behalf.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeping your accounts and credentials secure;</li>
    <li>Revoking access if you believe credentials are compromised; and</li>
    <li>Reviewing and managing any permissions you grant via TikTok or other platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your content and responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    You remain the owner of any videos, text, audio, and other material (“Content”)
    that you create or upload using the Service. You are solely responsible for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Content you upload or publish; and</li>
    <li>Ensuring your Content complies with all applicable laws and with each platform’s
      policies and guidelines (for example, TikTok’s Community Guidelines).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You agree not to use the Service to post or promote Content that is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Illegal, harmful, or deceptive;</li>
    <li>Hateful, harassing, or abusive;</li>
    <li>Sexually explicit or exploitative; or</li>
    <li>Infringing on the rights (including copyright and privacy) of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Use of AI-generated content</h2>
  <p>
    Tingly Giggles may assist with generating ideas or text using artificial
    intelligence (“AI”). Any AI-generated suggestions are provided for your
    convenience only. You are responsible for reviewing, editing, and approving
    any AI-generated material before publishing it. You should not rely on AI
    output as professional advice of any kind.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Service changes and availability</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is provided on an experimental and “as-is” basis. Features may
    change, break, or be removed at any time without notice. We do not guarantee:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Service;</li>
    <li>That uploads will always succeed or be processed by third-party platforms; or</li>
    <li>Any particular results, reach, or “virality” of your Content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>
    The Service, including its scripts, branding, and documentation, is owned by
    the creator of Tingly Giggles. You are granted a personal, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable licence to use the Service solely for managing your own
    content, subject to these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may not reverse engineer, sell, or publicly distribute the Service or any
    part of it without prior written permission.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tingly Giggles and its creator will
    not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
    punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
    directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other
    intangible losses, resulting from:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service;</li>
    <li>Any conduct or Content of third parties; or</li>
    <li>Unauthorised access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or Content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tingly Giggles and its creator from
    any claims, losses, or damages (including reasonable legal fees) arising from
    your use of the Service, your Content, or your violation of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service
    after any changes means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>
